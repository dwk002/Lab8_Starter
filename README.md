# Lab 8 - Starter

**Check your Understanding**
1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

*Reasoning:* We want to keep checking the code quality and functionality as we develop, 
not all at the end. A good way to consantly test during development is to test every time code is pushed.
This also ensures that all contributors' code is checked! 

2.  Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output?

No! It is meant to check the entire software product. Checking functions is more suitable for unit testing.
